      "the fact that a film is on dvd doesnt guarantee that its quality is very good the fact that a films quality is threadbare doesnt mean you shouldnt buy it this review actually applies to 2 films paired on a single dvdbr br the plots of these films are of little consequence they are of interest only to people who collect holmes films anybody who merely wants a few of the better offerings would do well to purchase some of those made by jeremy brett or in a pinch basil rathbone there are a few other very good holmes films featuring good actors on a oneshot basis such as seven per cent solution or private life of sherlock holmes in any event these films are considerably less estimablebr br here we have a pair of films featuring some of the best actors to do holmes even if the results tend toward disappointing this appears to be the only disc with these films on it although deadly necklace appears by itself in the same version on other discsbr br sherlock holmes and the deadly necklace dates from 1962 although it neither looks it nor sounds it some who have seen this may be surprised to learn that it was produce by hammer studios not that hammer hasnt turned out some really schlock stuff but where christopher lee was concerned they usually did a better job the print a direct transfer from a rather worn 1133 copy in blackand white the quality of the color suggests the original may have been in color and the snipped ends of the films aspect suggest it may originally have been 1166 or morebr br the film is set in the early 20th century not improbable since holmes was still working then and didnt actually die until 1957 however the script is not adapted from any actual doyle story it involves an egyptian necklace and professor moriarty shows up as a worldfamous archaeologist as well as the prince of crime the plot is melodramatic and banalbr br the biggest defect of this film is that for whatever unfathomable reason hammer filmed it in germany it was nonetheless filmed in english it was then dubbed in german and then redubbed in english so what you hear isnt lee nor any of the other original actors but a bunch of unknowns not that outside of lee i doubt anyone would know any of the other actors this is too bad since lee see his hound of the baskervilles makes a quite decent holmes as it is his voice double is condescending and plain as bread pudding with no raisins nor cinnamonbr br the music for this film is primarily jazzy in a possible attempt to be period too bad nobody thought of ragtime as it is the music doesnt relate to whats happening on the screen and often is at odds with the actionbr br the other film is sherlock holmes and the speckled band from 1931 starring a young raymond massey the quality of the picture and sound is fully up to that of the 1962 effort and in fact a bit better massey makes a quite respectable holmes although he certainly doesnt own the rôle in the way rathbone did and brett does the other thespians who take part in this production are unlikely to be of interest to modern readers the acting as is true of many films of this period owes a lot to the postvictorian stage and to silent filmsbr br it should be noted that while the deadly necklace is available on dvd by itself the speckled band is available only with the former filmbr br there is very little else to be said of this film the settings seem to be an odd combination of the 1890s horsedrawn carriages and the 1920s electronic devices such as a primitive dictaphone taken altogether its an interesting curio and a sufficient inducement to buy the dvd with the pairing rather than a dvd with deadly necklace only\n",

      "i was very disappointed with this series it had lots of cool graphics and thats about it the level of detail it went into was minimal and i always got the feeling the audience was being patronized there was a lot of what seemed to me as this is extremely cool but were not going to explain it in further detail because you wont get it anyway lets just show you some pretty pictures to entertain you the host would drop interestingsounding words such as sparticles and supersymmetry without any attempt at explaining what it was we had to look it up on wikipediabr br furthermore i know quite a bit about superstrings for a layman and i found their explanations were convoluted and could have been so much better they could have chosen much better examples to explain concepts but instead the examples they used were confusing and further obscured the subjectbr br additionally i got so sick of the repetitiveness they could easily have condensed the series into one episode if they had cut out all the repetition they must have shown the clips of the quantum café about 8 times the host kept saying the same things over and over and over again i cant remember how many times he said the universe is made out of tiny little vibrating strings its like they were trying to brainwash us into just accepting superstrings are the best thing since sliced breadbr br finally the show ended off with an unpleasant sense of a competition between fermilab and cern clearly biased towards fermilab this is supposed to be an educational program about quantum physics not about whether the us is better than europe or vice versa i also felt that was part of the patronizing audiences need to see some conflict to remain interested please give me a little more credit than thatbr br overall 2 thumbs down\n",

      "happy days was produced and broadcast from the mid1970s to the early 1980s and seems to get more ridiculous with age at the time of its broadcast most viewers who grew up in the 1950s were in middle age with families and the scenes at mels diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them the fonz was of course the coolest of the cool although the actor henry wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle richie cunningham was the allamerican blondhaired kid who would probably be elected student body president potsie was richies best friendthe star of the show has to have a best friend i guess and ralph malph was the bumbling sidekick to the fonz if not the entire group i loved it when the fonz would beat up on poor ralph malph and there was mel the middleaged lug who ran mels diner and of course who could forget the appearance of mork was this really the 1950s ironically films produced during the 1950s such as rebel without a cause and the wild one have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portraysbr br unfortunately the tv show happy days is not in the same league as rebel without a cause or american graffitti for that matter happy days may have captured some aspects of the 1950s with its burger diner juke boxes cool cars and tacky plaid shirts but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal american graffitti had something to say about young americans in the 1950s whereas happy days seemed more about what middleaged people of the 1970s wished the 1950s had been like the result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950s happy days is at best a comedyfantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950s as its backdrop as pointed out by another reviewer the allamerican kid richie cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a dropout like fonzie and mel would probably forbid fonzie from entering his dinerbr br a quick history happy days was originally a pilot called love in the happy days that was rejected for broadcast comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show love american style which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations andor alterations in short love american style was a throwaway show that contained all these oneepisode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut love in the happy days did appear as a love american style show sometime in the early 1970s but at the time tv executives could not foresee how a show about 1950s young people would be popular particularly during the heyday of comedy shows centering around middleaged people such as the mary tyler moore show and its subsequent spinoffs such rhoda the bob newhart show and all in the family how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middleaged people like the plague br br subsequently one of the young stars of love in the happy days a child actor from the andy griffith show named ron howard got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called american graffitti directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous thx 1138 had bombed miserably at the box office even when it was premiered to movie executives again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950s could become popular because it didnt fit with what had been popular in the past although they didnt realize that much of the moviegoing audience had been young in the 1950s as everyone knows the movie was a huge hit and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience somewhere during the theatrical run of american graffitti tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like american graffitti they brought it back with the original cast plus henry wrinkler as the fonz retitled it happy days and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970sbr br happy days now seems ridiculous the characters are flat and cardboard never being more or less than what they superficially are the issues they deal with are trivial and their reactions appear mindless and even silly nowadays the character of the fonz seems to be a caricature of well the fonz was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon brandos character in the wild one looking on the show with fresh eyes i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950s with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks this is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time american graffitti has many of the outward appearances of happy days but it had an edge it had an honesty about the characters and their issues happy days took the look of american graffitti but failed to take its heart\n",
